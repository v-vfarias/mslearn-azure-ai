# Build an agent tool backend on Azure Database for PostgreSQL

In this exercise, you create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance that serves as a tool backend for an AI agent. The database stores conversation context and task state that an agent can read and write during operation. You design a schema for agent memory, build Python functions that serve as agent tools, and test the complete workflow. This pattern provides a foundation for building AI agents that maintain persistent memory across sessions and can resume interrupted tasks.

Tasks performed in this exercise:

- Download project starter files and configure the deployment script
- Deploy an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Microsoft Entra authentication
- Build Python tool functions for conversation and task state management
- Create a database schema for agent memory with tables for conversations, messages, and task checkpoints
- Test the agent memory workflow using a provided test script
- Query conversation context using SQL

This exercise takes approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

To complete the exercise, you need:

- An Azure subscription with the permissions to deploy the necessary Azure services. If you don't already have one, you can [sign up for one](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- The latest version of the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or greater.
- [PostgreSQL command-line tools](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (**psql**)

## Download project starter files and deploy Azure services

In this section you download the project starter files and use a script to deploy the necessary services to your Azure subscription. The PostgreSQL server deployment takes a few minutes to complete.

1. Open a browser and enter the following URL to download the starter file. The file will be saved in your default download location.

    ```
    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ai/raw/main/downloads/python/postgresql-build-agent-python.zip
    ```

1. Copy, or move, the file to a location in your system where you want to work on the project. Then unzip the file into a folder.

1. Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and select **File > Open Folder...** in the menu, then choose the folder containing the project files.

1. The project contains deployment scripts for both Bash (*azdeploy.sh*) and PowerShell (*azdeploy.ps1*). Open the appropriate file for your environment and change the two values at the top of the script to meet your needs, then save your changes. **Note:** Do not change anything else in the script.

    ```
    "<your-resource-group-name>" # Resource Group name
    "<your-azure-region>" # Azure region for the resources
    ```

1. In the menu bar select **Terminal > New Terminal** to open a terminal window in VS Code.

1. Run the following command to login to your Azure account. Answer the prompts to select your Azure account and subscription for the exercise.

    ```
    az login
    ```

1. Run the following command to ensure your subscription has the necessary resource provider for the exercise.

    ```azurecli
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL
    ```

### Create resources in Azure

In this section you run the deployment script to deploy the PostgreSQL.

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project and run the appropriate command in the terminal to launch the deployment script.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    bash azdeploy.sh
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    ./azdeploy.ps1
    ```

    > **Note:** If PowerShell blocks the script because it is not digitally signed, run the following command in the same terminal session, then run the deployment script again. This command changes the execution policy only for the current PowerShell process.

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    ```

1. When the script menu appears, enter **1** to launch the **Create PostgreSQL server with Entra authentication** option. This creates the server with Entra-only authentication enabled. **Note:** Deployment can take 5-10 minutes to complete.

    >**IMPORTANT:** Leave the terminal running the deployment open for the duration of the exercise. You can move on to the next section of the exercise while the deployment continues in the terminal.

## Complete the tool function app

In this section you complete the *agent_tools.py* file by adding functions that an AI agent can call to persist and retrieve state. These functions serve as the agent's interface to the database. The *test_workflow.py* script, which you run later in this exercise, imports these functions to demonstrate how an agent would use them.

1. Open the *agent-backend/agent_tools.py* file in VS Code.

1. Search for the **BEGIN CREATE CONVERSATION FUNCTION** comment and add the following code directly after the comment. This function creates a new conversation record with a unique session ID and stores optional metadata as JSONB.

    ```python
    def create_conversation(user_id: str, metadata: dict = None) -> dict:
        """Create a new conversation and return its details."""
        session_id = uuid.uuid4()
        with get_connection() as conn:
            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute(
                    """
                    INSERT INTO conversations (session_id, user_id, metadata)
                    VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
                    RETURNING id, session_id, started_at
                    """,
                    (str(session_id), user_id, psycopg.types.json.Json(metadata or {}))
                )
                row = cur.fetchone()
                conn.commit()
                return {
                    "conversation_id": row[0],
                    "session_id": str(row[1]),
                    "started_at": row[2].isoformat()
                }
    ```

1. Search for the **BEGIN RETRIEVE CONVERSATION HISTORY FUNCTION** comment and add the following code directly after the comment. This function retrieves messages from a conversation, ordered chronologically.

    ```python
    def get_conversation_history(conversation_id: int, limit: int = 50) -> list:
        """Retrieve recent messages from a conversation."""
        with get_connection() as conn:
            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute(
                    """
                    SELECT id, role, content, created_at, metadata
                    FROM messages
                    WHERE conversation_id = %s
                    ORDER BY created_at DESC
                    LIMIT %s
                    """,
                    (conversation_id, limit)
                )
                rows = cur.fetchall()
                return [
                    {
                        "id": row[0],
                        "role": row[1],
                        "content": row[2],
                        "created_at": row[3].isoformat(),
                        "metadata": row[4]
                    }
                    for row in reversed(rows)  # Return in chronological order
                ]
    ```

1. Search for the **BEGIN TASK CHECKPOINT FUNCTIONS** comment and add the following code directly after the comment. This function uses an upsert pattern to save or update task state, allowing the agent to resume interrupted tasks.

    ```python
    def save_task_state(conversation_id: int, task_name: str, status: str, checkpoint_data: dict) -> dict:
        """Save or update a task checkpoint."""
        with get_connection() as conn:
            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute(
                    """
                    INSERT INTO task_checkpoints (conversation_id, task_name, status, checkpoint_data)
                    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)
                    ON CONFLICT (conversation_id, task_name)
                    DO UPDATE SET
                        status = EXCLUDED.status,
                        checkpoint_data = EXCLUDED.checkpoint_data,
                        updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
                    RETURNING id, updated_at
                    """,
                    (conversation_id, task_name, status, psycopg.types.json.Json(checkpoint_data))
                )
                row = cur.fetchone()
                conn.commit()
                return {
                    "checkpoint_id": row[0],
                    "updated_at": row[1].isoformat()
                }
    ```

1. Save your changes to the *agent_tools.py* file.

1. Take a few minutes to review all of the code in the app.

Next, you finalize the Azure resource deployment.

## Complete the Azure resource deployment

In this section you return to the deployment script to configure the Microsoft Entra administrator and retrieve the connection information for the PostgreSQL server.

1. When the **Create PostgreSQL server with Entra authentication** operation has completed, enter **2** to launch the **Configure Microsoft Entra administrator** option. This sets your Azure account as the database administrator.

1. When the previous operation completes, enter **3** to launch the **Check deployment status** option. This verifies the server is ready.

1. Enter **4** to launch the **Retrieve connection info and access token** option. This creates a file with the necessary environment variables.

1. Enter **5** to exit the deployment script.

1. Run the following command to load the environment variables into your terminal session from the file created in a previous step.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    source .env
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    . .\.env.ps1
    ```

    >**Note:** Keep the terminal open. If you close it and create a new terminal, you might need to run the command to create the environment variable again.

    >**Note:** The access token expires after approximately one hour. If you need to reconnect later, run the script again and select option **4** to generate a new token, then export the variables again.

Next, you create the schema to support the agent.

## Create the agent memory schema with **psql**

In this section you connect to the PostgreSQL server using the **psql** command-line tool and create the database schema for agent memory. The schema includes three tables: one for conversations (agent sessions), one for messages within those conversations, and one for task checkpoints that enable the agent to resume interrupted work.

1. Run the following command to connect to the server using the environment variables. The **PGPASSWORD** environment variable is automatically used for authentication.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    psql "host=$DB_HOST port=5432 dbname=$DB_NAME user=$DB_USER sslmode=require"
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    psql "host=$env:DB_HOST port=5432 dbname=$env:DB_NAME user=$env:DB_USER sslmode=require"
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify the connection by checking the PostgreSQL version.

    ```sql
    SELECT version();
    ```
1. Run the following command to create a database for the agent backend. The **\c** command connects to the new database.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE agent_memory;
    \c agent_memory
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a table for conversations (agent sessions). This table stores session metadata and links messages to a specific conversation.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE conversations (
        id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        session_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        ended_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
        metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
    );
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a table for messages within conversations. This table stores the role (user, assistant, system, or tool) and content for each message.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE messages (
        id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        conversation_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant', 'system', 'tool')),
        content TEXT NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
    );
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a table for task checkpoints. This table enables agent state persistence so the agent can resume interrupted tasks.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE task_checkpoints (
        id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        conversation_id BIGINT REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        task_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed')),
        checkpoint_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

1. Run the following command to create indexes that optimize common queries. These indexes improve performance when retrieving messages by conversation or timestamp.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_id ON messages(conversation_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_messages_created_at ON messages(created_at);
    CREATE INDEX idx_task_checkpoints_conversation_id ON task_checkpoints(conversation_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_session_id ON conversations(session_id);
    ```

1. The app you completed earlier in the exercise uses **ON CONFLICT**, which requires a unique constraint. Run the following command in your **psql** session in the terminal to add it.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE task_checkpoints
    ADD CONSTRAINT unique_conversation_task
    UNIQUE (conversation_id, task_name);
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify the schema was created correctly.

    ```sql
    \dt
    ```

    You should see the three tables listed.

1. Enter `exit` to close the **psql** session and return to the terminal.

## Test the agent memory workflow

In this section you run a test script to verify the tool functions work correctly. The *test_workflow.py* script is included in the project files and demonstrates creating conversations, storing messages, and managing task checkpoints.

1. Run the following command to navigate to the *agent-backend* directory.

    ```
    cd agent-backend
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a virtual environment for the *test_workflow.py*  app. Depending on your environment the command might be **python** or **python3**.

    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

1. Run the following command to activate the Python environment. **Note:** On Linux/macOS, use the Bash command. On Windows, use the PowerShell command. If using Git Bash on Windows, use **source .venv/Scripts/activate**.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

1. Run the following command to install the Python dependencies for the app. This installs the **psycopg** library for PostgreSQL connectivity and **azure-identity** for Microsoft Entra authentication.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the following command to execute the test script. This script exercises all the agent tool functions you created.

    ```bash
    python test_workflow.py
    ```

1. You should see output showing each step completing successfully, demonstrating that the agent can create conversations, store messages, save task state, and retrieve history.

1. Optional: Open the *test_workflow.py* file and review the code.

## Query conversation context

In this section you practice querying the data an agent would use to make decisions.

1. Run the following command to connect to the **agent_memory** database using the environment variables.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    psql "host=$DB_HOST port=5432 dbname=agent_memory user=$DB_USER sslmode=require"
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    psql "host=$env:DB_HOST port=5432 dbname=agent_memory user=$env:DB_USER sslmode=require"
    ```

    >**Tip:** When query results are displayed, psql uses a pager if it can't fit the results in the current terminal window. If it does, press **q** to exit the pager and return to the psql prompt. Maximizing the terminal window will reduce this from happening, and make it easier to review the results from the commands.

1. Run the following query to find all conversations for a specific user. The test script created a conversation with **user_id** set to **user_123**.

    ```sql
    SELECT id, session_id, started_at, metadata
    FROM conversations
    WHERE user_id = 'user_123'
    ORDER BY started_at DESC;
    ```

1. Run the following query to get recent messages across all conversations. This returns the messages stored by the test script.

    ```sql
    SELECT c.session_id, m.role, m.content, m.created_at
    FROM messages m
    JOIN conversations c ON m.conversation_id = c.id
    ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following query to find completed tasks. The test script updated the task status to **completed** at the end of the workflow.

    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.session_id,
        t.task_name,
        t.status,
        t.checkpoint_data,
        t.updated_at
    FROM task_checkpoints t
    JOIN conversations c ON t.conversation_id = c.id
    WHERE t.status = 'completed';
    ```

1. Run the following query to count messages by role in each conversation. This helps understand the distribution of user, assistant, system, and tool messages.

    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.id AS conversation_id,
        m.role,
        COUNT(*) AS message_count
    FROM conversations c
    JOIN messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id
    GROUP BY c.id, m.role
    ORDER BY c.id, m.role;
    ```

1. Enter **quit** in the psql prompt to exit.

## Summary

In this exercise, you built a PostgreSQL-based tool backend for AI agents. You deployed an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Microsoft Entra authentication, created Python functions that agents can call to manage conversations and task state, and designed a database schema with tables for conversations, messages, and task checkpoints. You tested the workflow by running a script that simulated agent operations, then queried the stored data using SQL. This pattern enables AI agents to maintain persistent memory across sessions and resume interrupted tasks.

# Clean up resources

Now that you finished the exercise, you should delete the cloud resources you created to avoid unnecessary resource usage.

1. Run the following command in the VS Code terminal to delete the resource group, and all resources in the group. Replace **\<rg-name>** with the name you choose earlier in the exercise. The command will launch a background task in Azure to delete the resource group.

    ```
    az group delete --name <rg-name> --no-wait --yes
    ```

> **CAUTION:** Deleting a resource group deletes all resources contained within it. If you chose an existing resource group for this exercise, any existing resources outside the scope of this exercise will also be deleted.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during this exercise, try these steps:

**psql connection fails**
- Ensure the *.env* file was created by running the deployment script option **4**
- Ensure you ran **source .env** (Bash) or **. .\.env.ps1** (PowerShell) to load environment variables
- The access token expires after approximately one hour; run the deployment script option **4** again to generate a new token
- Verify the server is ready by running the deployment script option **3**

**Access denied or authentication errors**
- Ensure the Microsoft Entra administrator was configured by running the deployment script option **2**
- Verify **PGPASSWORD** is set correctly in your terminal session
- Ensure you're using the correct **DB_USER** value (your Azure account email)

**Python test script fails**
- Ensure Python virtual environment is activated (you should see **(.venv)** in your terminal prompt)
- Ensure dependencies are installed: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
- Ensure you created the **agent_memory** database and all tables in **psql**
- Ensure you added the unique constraint on **task_checkpoints** table

**Database or table not found errors**
- Ensure you connected to the **agent_memory** database using **\c agent_memory** in **psql**
- Verify tables exist by running **\dt** in **psql**
- Re-run the CREATE TABLE statements if tables are missing

**Python venv activation issues**
- On Linux/macOS, use: **source .venv/bin/activate**
- On Windows PowerShell, use: **.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1**
- If **activate** script is missing, reinstall **python3-venv** package and recreate the venv
