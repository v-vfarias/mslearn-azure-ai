# Optimize vector search performance in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

In this exercise, you deploy an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance and optimize it for vector search workloads. You create test data with vector embeddings, analyze baseline performance, build and compare IVFFlat and HNSW indexes, and tune search parameters. These techniques are essential for production AI applications that require fast similarity search across large datasets.

Tasks performed in this exercise:

- Download project starter files and configure the deployment script
- Deploy an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Microsoft Entra authentication
- Create a test dataset with vector embeddings
- Analyze baseline vector search performance without indexes
- Create and compare IVFFlat and HNSW vector indexes
- Tune index parameters to balance speed and recall

This exercise takes approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

To complete the exercise, you need:

- An Azure subscription with the permissions to deploy the necessary Azure services. If you don't already have one, you can [sign up for one](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- The latest version of the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- [PostgreSQL command-line tools](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (**psql**)

## Download project starter files and deploy Azure services

In this section you download the project starter files and use a script to deploy the necessary services to your Azure subscription. The PostgreSQL server deployment takes a few minutes to complete.

1. Open a browser and enter the following URL to download the starter file. The file will be saved in your default download location.

    ```
    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ai/raw/main/downloads/python/postgresql-optimize-vector-search-python.zip
    ```

1. Copy, or move, the file to a location in your system where you want to work on the project. Then unzip the file into a folder.

1. Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and select **File > Open Folder...** in the menu, then choose the folder containing the project files.

1. The project contains deployment scripts for both Bash (*azdeploy.sh*) and PowerShell (*azdeploy.ps1*). Open the appropriate file for your environment and change the two values at the top of the script to meet your needs, then save your changes. **Note:** Do not change anything else in the script.

    ```
    "<your-resource-group-name>" # Resource Group name
    "<your-azure-region>" # Azure region for the resources
    ```

1. In the menu bar select **Terminal > New Terminal** to open a terminal window in VS Code.

    >**Tip:** This entire exercise is performed in the terminal. Maximize the panel size to make it easier to view the results of the commands.

1. Run the following command to log in to your Azure account. Answer the prompts to select your Azure account and subscription for the exercise.

    ```
    az login
    ```

1. Run the following command to ensure your subscription has the necessary resource provider for the exercise.

    ```azurecli
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL
    ```

### Create resources in Azure

In this section you run the deployment script to deploy the PostgreSQL server and configure authentication.

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project and run the appropriate command in the terminal to launch the deployment script.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    bash azdeploy.sh
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    ./azdeploy.ps1
    ```

    > **Note:** If PowerShell blocks the script because it is not digitally signed, run the following command in the same terminal session, then run the deployment script again. This command changes the execution policy only for the current PowerShell process.

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    ```

1. When the script menu appears, enter **1** to launch the **Create PostgreSQL server with Entra authentication** option. This creates the server with Entra-only authentication enabled. **Note:** Deployment can take 5-10 minutes to complete.

    >**IMPORTANT:** Leave the terminal running the deployment open for the duration of the exercise. You can move on to the next section of the exercise while the deployment continues in the terminal.

## Review vector index concepts

In this section you review the key concepts for vector indexing that you apply later in the exercise. Understanding these trade-offs helps you make informed decisions when optimizing vector search.

### IVFFlat indexes

IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat compression) divides vectors into clusters called **lists**. When searching, it only scans vectors in nearby clusters rather than the entire dataset.

Key parameters:

- **lists**: Number of clusters to create. A good starting point is `rows / 1000` for up to 1 million rows. More lists means faster searches but slower index builds.
- **probes**: Number of clusters to search at query time. Higher values improve recall (finding the true nearest neighbors) but increase latency.

### HNSW indexes

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) builds a multi-layer graph structure. Upper layers contain fewer nodes for fast navigation; lower layers contain more nodes for precise searching.

Key parameters:

- **m**: Maximum connections per node. Higher values improve recall but increase memory usage and build time. Default is 16.
- **ef_construction**: Size of the dynamic candidate list during index building. Higher values create better quality graphs but take longer to build. Default is 64.
- **ef_search**: Size of the dynamic candidate list during search. Higher values improve recall but increase latency. Default is 40.

### When to use each

| Consideration | IVFFlat | HNSW |
|---------------|---------|------|
| Build time | Faster | Slower |
| Query speed | Fast | Faster |
| Memory usage | Lower | Higher |
| Recall accuracy | Good with tuning | Better out of box |
| Update performance | Requires rebuilding | Supports incremental |

For this exercise, you test both index types and measure the trade-offs firsthand.

## Complete the Azure resource deployment

In this section you return to the deployment script to configure the Microsoft Entra administrator and retrieve the connection information for the PostgreSQL server.

1. When the **Create PostgreSQL server with Entra authentication** operation has completed, enter **2** to launch the **Configure Microsoft Entra administrator** option. This sets your Azure account as the database administrator.

1. When the previous operation completes, enter **3** to launch the **Check deployment status** option. This verifies the server is ready.

1. Enter **4** to launch the **Retrieve connection info and access token** option. This creates a file with the necessary environment variables.

1. Enter **5** to exit the deployment script.

1. Run the following command to load the environment variables into your terminal session from the file created in a previous step.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    source .env
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    . .\.env.ps1
    ```

    >**Note:** Keep the terminal open. If you close it and create a new terminal, you might need to run the command to load the environment variables again.

    >**Note:** The access token expires after approximately one hour. If you need to reconnect later, run the script again and select option **4** to generate a new token, then export the variables again.

## Create the database schema and test data

In this section you connect to the PostgreSQL server and create a table with product data and vector embeddings for testing.

1. Run the following command to connect to the server using the environment variables. The **PGPASSWORD** environment variable is automatically used for authentication.

    **Bash**
    ```bash
    psql "host=$DB_HOST port=5432 dbname=$DB_NAME user=$DB_USER sslmode=require"
    ```

    **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    psql "host=$env:DB_HOST port=5432 dbname=$env:DB_NAME user=$env:DB_USER sslmode=require"
    ```

    >**Tip:** When query results are displayed, psql uses a pager if it can't fit the results in the current terminal window. If it does, press **q** to exit the pager and return to the psql prompt. Maximizing the terminal window will reduce this from happening, and make it easier to review the results from the commands.

1. Run the following command to enable the pgvector extension. PostgreSQL extensions must be explicitly enabled before use. The pgvector extension adds the **vector** data type and operators like **<=>** (cosine distance) that you use throughout this exercise. Azure Database for PostgreSQL includes pgvector but doesn't enable it by default.

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
    ```

1. Run the following command to create the products table with a vector column. The **vector(384)** data type stores 384-dimensional embeddings, a common size for sentence embedding models.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE products (
        id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        category_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        price NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
        in_stock BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
        embedding vector(384)
    );
    ```

1. Run the following command to generate test data with random embeddings. This creates 100,000 products with random 384-dimensional vectors.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO products (name, category_id, price, in_stock, embedding)
    SELECT
        'Product ' || i,
        (random() * 20)::int + 1,
        (random() * 1000)::numeric(10,2),
        random() > 0.1,
        ('[' || array_to_string(ARRAY(
            SELECT (random() * 2 - 1)::float4
            FROM generate_series(1, 384)
        ), ',') || ']')::vector
    FROM generate_series(1, 100000) AS i;
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify the data was created. You should see 100,000 rows.

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a query vector for consistent testing. This temporary table stores a random embedding you use throughout the exercise.

    ```sql
    CREATE TEMP TABLE query_vectors AS
    SELECT ('[' || array_to_string(ARRAY(
        SELECT (random() * 2 - 1)::float4
        FROM generate_series(1, 384)
    ), ',') || ']')::vector AS embedding;
    ```

## Analyze baseline performance

In this section you measure vector search performance without any indexes to establish a baseline.

1. Run the following command to execute a vector similarity query and capture the execution plan.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Examine the output. You should see a **Seq Scan** in the plan, indicating PostgreSQL is scanning all 100,000 rows. Note the **Execution Time** value at the bottom.

1. Run the query two more times to get consistent measurements. The first run might be slower due to cold caches. Record the last execution time as your baseline.

## Create and compare IVFFlat and HNSW indexes

In this section you create both index types and compare their performance.

### Create an IVFFlat index

1. Run the following command to create an IVFFlat index. For 100,000 rows, 100 lists is a reasonable starting point (using the `rows / 1000` guideline). Note the time taken to build the index.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_products_embedding_ivfflat
    ON products USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
    WITH (lists = 100);
    ```

1. Run the following command to execute the same query with the IVFFlat index. Verify the plan shows **Index Scan using idx_products_embedding_ivfflat**. Record the execution time.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following command to test with low probes. This is faster but might miss the true nearest neighbors than a full scan since it only searches one cluster. The recall impact isn't visible in timing output - you'd need to compare actual results to measure it.

    ```sql
    SET ivfflat.probes = 1;
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following command to test with high probes (slower, higher recall). Record the execution time.

    ```sql
    SET ivfflat.probes = 50;
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

### Create an HNSW index

1. Run the following command to drop the IVFFlat index so you can test HNSW independently.

    ```sql
    DROP INDEX idx_products_embedding_ivfflat;
    ```

1. Run the following command to increase the memory available for index building. HNSW indexes require more memory during construction than IVFFlat.

    ```sql
    SET maintenance_work_mem = '256MB';
    ```

1. Run the following command to create an HNSW index. Note the build time, which is typically longer than IVFFlat.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_products_embedding_hnsw
    ON products USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
    WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
    ```

1. Run the following command to execute the query with the HNSW index.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following command to test with low ef_search. This is faster but might miss some true nearest neighbors since the search explores fewer candidate paths. The recall impact isn't visible in timing output.

    ```sql
    SET hnsw.ef_search = 20;
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following command to test with high ef_search (higher recall). Record the execution time.

    ```sql
    SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

### Compare your results

Compare your execution times across the different configurations. You should observe:

- **Sequential scan** is the slowest since it examines all 100,000 rows
- **IVFFlat with probes=1** is the fastest indexed option but might miss some true nearest neighbors
- **HNSW** generally provides faster queries than IVFFlat at similar recall levels
- Increasing **probes** (IVFFlat) or **ef_search** (HNSW) improves accuracy but increases latency

## Implement metadata filtering with indexes

In this section you test queries that combine vector similarity with metadata filters. In production applications, pure vector search is rare - you typically filter by category, date range, price, or other attributes before finding similar items. Optimizing these combined queries requires understanding how PostgreSQL uses multiple index types together.

1. Run the following command to create a B-tree index on the category column.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products (category_id);
    ```

1. Run the following command to execute a filtered vector search. Examine the execution plan - you should see PostgreSQL using the HNSW index for vector similarity and then applying the category filter. Note the execution time.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    WHERE category_id = 5
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following command to test with a more selective filter. With multiple filter conditions, you might see a **Bitmap Index Scan** on the B-tree index combined with post-filtering, or the planner might choose a different strategy. Compare the execution time to the previous query.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    WHERE category_id = 5 AND price BETWEEN 100 AND 200
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a composite index for the filter combination.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products (category_id, price);
    ```

1. Re-run the previous query and compare the execution plan. The composite index might allow PostgreSQL to filter more efficiently before or alongside the vector search, potentially reducing execution time.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT id, name, embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors) AS distance
    FROM products
    WHERE category_id = 5 AND price BETWEEN 100 AND 200
    ORDER BY embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_vectors)
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

## Summary

In this exercise, you:

- Deployed an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Microsoft Entra authentication
- Created a test dataset with 100,000 vector embeddings
- Established baseline performance for vector queries without indexes
- Created and compared IVFFlat and HNSW indexes
- Tuned index parameters (**probes** and **ef_search**) to balance accuracy and speed
- Implemented metadata filtering with B-tree indexes

These techniques enable you to optimize Azure Database for PostgreSQL for production vector search workloads.

# Clean up resources

Now that you finished the exercise, you should delete the cloud resources you created to avoid unnecessary resource usage.

1. Run the following command in the VS Code terminal to delete the resource group, and all resources in the group. Replace **\<rg-name>** with the name you choose earlier in the exercise. The command will launch a background task in Azure to delete the resource group.

    ```
    az group delete --name <rg-name> --no-wait --yes
    ```

> **CAUTION:** Deleting a resource group deletes all resources contained within it. If you chose an existing resource group for this exercise, any existing resources outside the scope of this exercise will also be deleted.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during this exercise, try these steps:

**psql connection fails**
- Ensure the *.env* file was created by running the deployment script option **4**
- Ensure you ran **source .env** (Bash) or **. .\.env.ps1** (PowerShell) to load environment variables
- The access token expires after approximately one hour; run the deployment script option **4** again to generate a new token
- Verify the server is ready by running the deployment script option **3**

**Access denied or authentication errors**
- Ensure the Microsoft Entra administrator was configured by running the deployment script option **2**
- Verify **PGPASSWORD** is set correctly in your terminal session
- Ensure you're using the correct **DB_USER** value (your Azure account email)

**Index build takes too long or fails**
- HNSW indexes take longer to build than IVFFlat; allow 1-2 minutes for 100,000 vectors
- If the build times out, check CPU and memory metrics in Azure Monitor
- Consider reducing the dataset size for testing
